    The Emira was launched at Hethel, England on 6 July 2021 and then presented at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on 8 July 2021.[6] It replaces the Evora, Exige and Elise.[3][4][7] The Emira's design bears several similarities to that of Lotus' high-performance car Evija, which was presented in 2019.[8]

Available in either 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Later on, a smaller 2.0 litre turbocharged engine sourced from
